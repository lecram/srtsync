srtsync -- SubRip synchronization tool
======================================

srtsync  provides simple  operations that  can be  used to  adjust the
stimestamps in ubtitles stored in SubRip (.srt) files.

Usually the best  way to synchronize subtitles to a  video is to first
determine  the correct  timestamp of  two lines  and then  stretch and
shift all  timestamps to fit the  two fixed points. This  operation is
more precise when the two reference points are distant from each other
in time  (e.g. the first  is near the beginning  of the video  and the
second is near the end).

Let's say we  have a video file  in which the line  "Lorem ipsum dolor
sit  amet." occurs  at 05:23  and  the line  "Excepteur sint  occaecat
cupidatat non  proident." occurs at  1:52:47 (of course,  these values
must be determined with the help of a video player). Supposing we have
a  file "lorem_ipsum.srt"  with the  video  subtitles, we  can do  the
following to find those lines in the file:

$ srtsync search 5m ipsum amet < lorem_ipsum.srt
11
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,057
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
$ srtsync search 1h53m cupidatat < lorem_ipsum.srt
1234
01:52:42,213 --> 01:52:43,722
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident.

The first line has  index 11 and the second line  has index 1234. They
are  clearly out  of  sync with  the video,  as  the timestamps  don't
coincide with  the previously estimated  values. To synchronize  it we
can do the following:

$ srtsync sync 11 5m23s 1234 1h52m47s < lorem_ipsum.srt > lorem_ipsum_sync.srt
scaled by 1.00052, shifted by +1.272s

Now we have  a file "lorem_ipsum_sync.srt" with the  same subtitles as
the original "lorem_ipsum.srt", but synchronized to our video file.

See srtsync(1) for usage details.
