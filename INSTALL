Building and installing srtsync
===============================

srtsync does  not depend on any  external library. It can  be compiled
with the following command:

$ cc -o srtsync srtsync.c

For systems that have a `make` command, a makefile is provided to help
build and install srtsync:

$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean

The  DESTDIR and  PREFIX variables  can  be used  to install  it on  a
non-standard location.
